# Ethereum Wallet

## Description

For this Challenge, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder
customer in order to do the following:

- Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase
  (which you created earlier in the module).

- Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account
  address.

- Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

- Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Web3.py** - a Python library that allows us to talk to Ethereum nodes in our favorite language, Python. Web3.py is a software development kit (SDK) like any other SDK you've used to talk to other APIs. But this time, the API originates from an Ethereum node.
- **Ganache** - Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.
- **streamlit**

## Installation

The required libraries are stored in `requirements.txt`. To install the required libraries, do the following:

1. Open Terminal
2. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
